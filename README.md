# PhoneBookTask

With regards to the implementation, I had made some assumptions:

- When editing a person, the front-end would possess the serial of the person that the user is changing, that way proper reference can be made.
- Logging and Exception handling was not included but are imperative for monitoring reasons.

During development system testing was also conducted to ensure that the full cycle from endpoint to database interaction is fully operational.
